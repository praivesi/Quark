# Quark

Quark is a scheduler that manages one's time through whole life.
Time is a movement of quark, so I named this scheduler "Quark" with the hope that I manage my movement well enough.

This is my fist MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node) project,
but I wish that this project will be usable to me and others because 
I've wanted to make my own scheduler pretty far ago.
